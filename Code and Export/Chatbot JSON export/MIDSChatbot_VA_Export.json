This will expedite the delivery of your transcript(s). \n- Start your conversation early with whom you plan on receiving recommendation letters from. Writing a thoughtful recommendation letter takes time- make sure you give them ample time to plan in advance and avoid having to rush to meet your application deadline.\n- All documents you submit must be in English. Otherwise a translated copy must be provided by an American Translation Association certified translator. \n- Time between admissions notification and the start of the term can be short, we strongly recommend that you have all necessary official documents in hand and are prepared to submit them as quickly as possible if you are recommended for admission. \n"
